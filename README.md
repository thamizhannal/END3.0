# END3.0
## END 3.0 Phase 1

Welcome to END 3.0 Phase 1.

 

This is the 3rd version of our Flagship NLP program. Our courses are in constant evolution. In END 1, we focused on modern NLP practices and introduced a bit of Transformers. In END 2, we covered Recurrent models, ending the course with Transformers. AI world has changed so fast that our END 2 course became obsolete within 4 months. 

In END 3, we will completely focus on Transformers with limited background on Recurrent models. Here is how your course structure looks like:

 

Session 0: Introduction to END 3.0

Session 1: Background and very basics

Session 1.5: Python 101 (will be conducted for all TSAI students on Saturday 6:30 AM live, but you can take it whenever you're comfortable)

Session 2: PyTorch 101

Session 3: Fully Connected Layers, Activation Functions, and MultiLayers

Session 4: Backpropagation, Embeddings, and Language Models

Session 5: 1st Hands-on Live Coding

Session 6: Introduction to NLP problems, Datasets, and Evaluation Metrics

Session 7: 2nd Hands-on Live Coding

Session 8: TorchText and Advanced Concepts

Session 9: Attention Mechanism and its Types

Session 10: 4th Hands-on Live Coding

Session 11: The Dawn of Transformers

Session 12: BERT, GPT1 and its NLP Applications

Session 13: BART and its NLP Applications

Session 14: 5th Hands-on Live Coding

Session 15: Advanced concepts and introduction to the Capstone Project

 

In END 3 we will cover applications like text classification, language modeling, information extraction, information retrieval, conversational agents, text summarization, question answering, machine translation, and topic modeling.
