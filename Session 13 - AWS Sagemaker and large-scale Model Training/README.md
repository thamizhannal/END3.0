# Assignment
 

Go through this notebook (Links to an external site.), change the dataset (to anything other than "Amazon Reviews Polarity Dataset").
Record the whole step using any video capturing software (like OBS). 
Upload the video on youtube (you can make it unlisted, but allow for embedding)
Share the link to your YouTube video, and the GitHub link where I can see the code you used for training (move the notebook with logs from Amazon to Github)
This is a long assignment and might take up to 2 weeks to finish, please start ASAP.
